    "- The model which will generate the completion. Some models are suitable for natural language tasks, others specialize in code.\n",
    "-  Temperature control randomness, lowering results in less random completions. As approach the zero, the model becomes more repetitive. Temp (=0.1), where the Temp parameter is responsible for the randomness of the response. A Temp approaching 0 makes the output more deterministic and repetitive.  Top P (= 0.09) where Top P is “An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered” (OpenAI, 2022).\n",
    "- Frequency Penalty (=0.05) where a frequency penalty is a number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalise new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model’s likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim (OpenAI, 2022). And  Presence penalty (=0) s (OpenAI, 2022) just checks whether the tokens have been present in the response or not. To improve the results for some tests, the parameters were changed."
