# how can I get the chatgpt source code?

The source code for the GPT (Generative Pre-training Transformer) models, including ChatGPT, is not publicly available. However, you can use the pre-trained models and the API provided by OpenAI to generate text, do language translation and more.

You can access the OpenAI API by creating an account at https://beta.openai.com/signup/ and then use the API key to access the pre-trained models. Additionally, you can use the open-source implementation of GPT-2 and GPT-3 provided by the Hugging Face, which allows you to fine-tune the pre-trained models on your own data.
