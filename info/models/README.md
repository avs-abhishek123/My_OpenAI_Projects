# OpenAI basic Models

- OpenAI has released a number of open source projects and libraries, including:

- GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer): A machine learning model for natural language processing tasks such as language translation and text summarization.

- GPT-2 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 2): A larger and more powerful version of GPT, designed for tasks such as language translation and content generation.

- GPT-3 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 3): The largest and most powerful version of GPT to date, with a capacity of 175 billion parameters. GPT-3 is designed for a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including language translation, question answering, and content generation.

- DALL-E: A machine learning model that can generate images from textual descriptions.

- RoboSumo: A reinforcement learning environment for training robotic agents to play the game of sumo.

- OpenAI Gym: A toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.

These are just a few examples of the open source projects and libraries released by OpenAI. You can find a complete list of their open source projects on the OpenAI GitHub page: [openAI](https://github.com/openai)
